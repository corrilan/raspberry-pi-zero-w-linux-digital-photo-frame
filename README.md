# raspberry-pi-zero-w-linux-digital-photo-frame

Python based digital photo frame aimed at running on a Linux Raspberry Pi Zero W.

<h1>Why?</h1>

Over the years I have accumulated thousands of digital photographs which get saved, stored, organised and backed up (always do your backups!).  I realised that very rarely were these photographs being viewed, so I decided that a digital photo frame was required so myself and my wife would get to see random photographs fro our collection, all day, every day.

Not keen on buying a small digital photo frame with limited features (I don't want to have to squint to see the photos!), I decided instead to build my own using an old laptop screen I happened to have lying around.  I wanted to build something where the feature set could easily be expanded over time. With the amount of e-waste now going to landfill, I thought it would also be nice to make use of laptop screens which would otherwise be disposed of with the rest of a broken laptop.

<h1>What features does the current code offer?</h1>

<ul>
<li>Photos can be displayed either full screen or in polaroid mode (see the photos/videos to get a feel for this).</li>
<li>Display automatically rotates the photos depending on how frame is oriented.</li>
<li>You can choose to display of 1, 2 or 3 polaroids on screen before they start to 'stack' up.</li>
<li>You can choose how long a photograph is displayed for before moving to the next.</li>
<li>The frames screen automatically turns of when a person has not been detected nearby within a customisable timeframe.</li>
<li>To aid initial setup, the frame acts as a wifi access point in order to connect it to your own wifi.</li>
<li>Photographs may be uploaded directly to the frame from any device with a web browser.</li>
<li>Integration into other open source projects such as the <a href="https://www.asterisk.org" target="_blank">Digium Asterisk<a> telecommunications system - when someone calls my landline, their details and a photograph appear on the frame.</li>
</ul>
