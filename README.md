# raspberry-pi-zero-w-linux-digital-photo-frame

Python based digital photo frame aimed at running on a Linux Raspberry Pi Zero W.

Why?

Not keen on buying a small digital photo frame with limited features, I decided instead to build my own using an old laptop screen I happened to have lying around. I wanted to build something that would be be easy to expand the feature set over time. With the amount of e-waste now going to landfill, I thought it would also be nice to make use of laptop screens which would otherwise be disposed of with the reset of a broken laptop.
