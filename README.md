# raspberry-pi-zero-w-linux-digital-photo-frame

Python based digital photo frame aimed at running on a Linux Raspberry Pi Zero W.

<h1>Why?</h1>

Over the years I have accumulated thousands of ditial photographs which get saved, stored, organised and backed up (always do your backups!).  I realised that very rarely were these photographs being viewed, so I decided that a digital photo frame was required so myself and my wife would get to see random photogaphs all day, every day.

Not keen on buying a small digital photo frame with limited features (I don't want to have to squint to see the photos!), I decided instead to build my own using an old laptop screen I happened to have lying around.  I wanted to build something that would be be easy to expand the feature set over time. With the amount of e-waste now going to landfill, I thought it would also be nice to make use of laptop screens which would otherwise be disposed of with the rest of a broken laptop.

What features does the current code offer?

<ol>
<li>Photos can be displayed either full screen or in polaroid mode (see the photos/videos to get a feel for this).</li>
<li>Display automatically rotates the photos depending on how frame is oriented - using 2 tilt switches.</li>
